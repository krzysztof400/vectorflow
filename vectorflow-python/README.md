# VectorFlow Python Library

VectorFlow is a Python library that provides efficient matrix operations and model implementations using C++ and CUDA for performance optimization. This library is designed for users who require high-performance computations in their Python applications.

## Features

- Matrix utility functions for efficient matrix operations.
- GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication using CUDA.
- Easy integration with Python through C++ bindings.

## Installation

To install the VectorFlow library, you need to have Python and the necessary build tools installed. You can install the library using the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, including a C++ compiler and CUDA toolkit for GPU support.

## Usage

After installing the library, you can use it in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
import vectorflow

# Example usage of matrix utilities
result = vectorflow.matrix_utils.some_matrix_function(args)

# Example usage of model
model = vectorflow.Model()
model.train(data)
